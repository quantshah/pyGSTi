    "\n",
    "By construction, the Direct and Mirror RB error rates depend on how the circuits are sampled. Essentially, these error rates quantify gate performance over circuits that are sampled according to the used sampling distribution. So we need to pick a sampling distribution that provides useful error rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second consideration is that Direct and Mirror RB are only reliable - i.e., the success probabilities decay exponentially and the error rates are easily interpreted - if the sampling distribution is sufficiently scrambling. To be \"sufficiently scrambling\" we need a high enough rate of two-qubit gates, in order to spread any errors that occur locally across the full set of qubits being benchmarked. We also need sufficient local randomization to quickly convert coherent to stochastic errors, to stop errors coherently adding across many layers."
