    "Like Direct RB, Mirror RB is a streamlined RB method partly inspired by [Clifford RB](RB-CliffordRB.ipynb). It has the same core purpose as Clifford RB - quantifying average gate performance - but it is feasable on more qubits, and it provides more directly useful information. However, Mirror RB is even more streamlined than Direct RB, making it feasable on 10s or 100s of qubits (it is possible to holistically benchmark around $1/\\epsilon$ qubits if the error rate per-gate per-qubit is around $\\epsilon$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Mirror RB can be implemented with non-Clifford gates, but pyGSTi currently only contains Mirror RB for Clifford gates. A depth $m$ ($m\\geq 0$) mirror RB circuit consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A uniformly random 1-qubit Clifford gate on every qubit. \n",
    "2. A \"compute\" circuit consisting of $m/2$ independently sampled layers of the native Clifford gates in the device, sampled according to a user-specified distribution $\\Omega$. Each of these layers is proceeded by a uniformly random Pauli gate on each qubit.\n",
    "3. A layer of uniformly random Pauli gates.\n",
    "4. An \"uncompute\" circuit consisting of the $m/2$ layers from step (2) in the reverse order with each gate replaced with its inverse. Each of these layers is followed by a uniformly random Pauli gate on each qubit, with these Pauli gates sampled *independently* of the Pauli layers in step (2).\n",
    "5. The inverse of the random 1-qubit Clifford gates in step (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "This construction means that Mirror RB circuits can be much shorter than Clifford RB circuits, or Direct RB circuits. Yet they still have the core randomization properties of both Clifford and Direct RB.\n",

This $\\Omega$-dependence is useful, because by carefully choosing or varying $\\Omega$ we can learn a lot about device performance. But it also means that the $\\Omega$ has to be carefully chosen! At the very least, **you need to know what sampling distribution you are using in order to interpret the results!**\n",
