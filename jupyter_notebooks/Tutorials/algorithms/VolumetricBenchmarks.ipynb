    "# Volumetric Benchmarks\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to compute volumetric benchmarks in pyGSTi.  Volumetric benchmarks map a (*width*, *depth*) pair to a test suite of circuits with (at least approximately) the given width and depth, and define an overall success measure that lies between 0 and 1 (1 indicating better performance on the test suite).  Thus, by collecting the success measures for many (width, depth) pairs, one can explore, in addition to the overall processor performance, the tradeoff between a quantum processor's ability to perform deep vs. wide circuits.  For more information on the theory and motivation for volumetric benchmarks, see [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05546).\n",

To each design we add a `ByDepthSummaryStatistics` \"default protocol\" to make it easier to run the protocols later (see step 3).  We decide to save some time (perhaps at the expense of increased crosstalk error) by performing some of these experiment designs simultaneously.  This is achieved by using multiple \"sub-designs\" to construct a `SimultaneousExperimentDesign`.  We create two simultaneous designs (one which performs two 2-qubit DRB test suites at the same time, the other which performs four 1-qubit DRB suites), and combine these using a `CombinedExperimentDesign`.  (Note that if we didn't want to run any of the suites simultaneously, we could have just combined all six DRB designs under a `CombinedExperimentDesign`.)\n",

This is done by running a `ByDepthSummaryStatistics` protocol on each of the DRB sub-designs.  The `ByDepthSummaryStatistics` protocol is able to compute many different \"summary\" metrics given a set of definite-outcome circuit data (like DRB data).  We supplied `ByDepthSummaryStatistics` instances as the default protocol to use for each experiment design, which allows us to conveniently run the protocols via the function `run_default_protocols` and have PyGSTi's protocol-object framework keep track of where each experiment designs sits within the nested hierarchy of designs. (This function walks through the tree of experiment designs and runs any and all default protocols.)  When creating the protocols, we specified that they should compute the single `'polarizaton'` metric, which we will utilize later on."
