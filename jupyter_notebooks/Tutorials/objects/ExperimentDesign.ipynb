In these cases you can just build a simple experiment design consisting of one or more lists of circuits.  The `ExperimentDesign` class is the base class of all experiment design in pyGSTi and contains just a simple list of cicuits along with the qubit labels these circuits act upon.  The slightly more complicated `CircuitListsDesign` structures its circuits into several (often nested) lists.  These circuit lists often describe the circuits used by successive stages of an a protocol, e.g. circuits with different numbers of Clifford gates or germ repetitions in RB or GST respectively.
