    TODO: update docstrings in this module -- new clifford_compilations arg to __init__ fns and pspec
           doesn't hold compilation libraries anymore.

    Experiment design for Clifford randomized benchmarking.

    This encapsulates a "Clifford randomized benchmarking" (CRB) experiment.  CRB is the RB protocol defined
    in "Scalable and robust randomized benchmarking of quantum processes", Magesan et al. PRL 106 180504 (2011).
    The circuits created by this function will respect the connectivity and gate-set of the device encoded
    by `pspec` (see the :class:`QubitProcessorSpec` object docstring for how to construct the relevant `pspec`
    for a device).

    Note that this function uses the convention that a depth "l" CRB circuit  consists of "l"+2 Clifford gates
    before compilation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pspec : QubitProcessorSpec
       The QubitProcessorSpec for the device that the CRB experiment is being generated for, which defines the
       "native" gate-set and the connectivity of the device. The returned CRB circuits will be over
       the gates in `pspec`, and will respect the connectivity encoded by `pspec`.

    depths : list of ints
        The "CRB depths" of the circuit; a list of integers >= 0. The CRB length is the number of Cliffords
        in the circuit - 2 *before* each Clifford is compiled into the native gate-set.

    circuits_per_depth : int
        The number of (possibly) different CRB circuits sampled at each length.

    qubit_labels : list, optional
        If not None, a list of the qubits that the RB circuits are to be sampled for. This should
        be all or a subset of the qubits in the device specified by the QubitProcessorSpec `pspec`.
        If None, it is assumed that the RB circuit should be over all the qubits. Note that the
        ordering of this list is the order of the ``wires'' in the returned circuit, but is otherwise
        irrelevant. If desired, a circuit that explicitly idles on the other qubits can be obtained
        by using methods of the Circuit object.

    randomizeout : bool, optional
        If False, the ideal output of the circuits (the "success" or "survival" outcome) is always
        the all-zeros bit string. This is probably considered to be the "standard" in CRB. If True,
        the ideal output a circuit is randomized to a uniformly random bit-string. This setting is
        useful for, e.g., detecting leakage/loss/measurement-bias etc.

    citerations : int, optional
        Some of the Clifford compilation algorithms in pyGSTi (including the default algorithm) are
        randomized, and the lowest-cost circuit is chosen from all the circuit generated in the
        iterations of the algorithm. This is the number of iterations used. The time required to
        generate a CRB circuit is linear in `citerations` * (CRB length + 2). Lower-depth / lower 2-qubit
        gate count compilations of the Cliffords are important in order to successfully implement
        CRB on more qubits.

    compilerargs : list, optional
        A list of arguments that are handed to compile_clifford() function, which includes all the
        optional arguments of compile_clifford() *after* the `iterations` option (set by `citerations`).
        In order, this list should be values for:
            - algorithm : str. A string that specifies the compilation algorithm. The default in
                compile_clifford() will always be whatever we consider to be the 'best' all-round
                algorith,
            - aargs : list. A list of optional arguments for the particular compilation algorithm.
            - costfunction : 'str' or function. The cost-function from which the "best" compilation
                for a Clifford is chosen from all `citerations` compilations. The default costs a
                circuit as 10x the num. of 2-qubit gates in the circuit + 1x the depth of the circuit.
            - prefixpaulis : bool. Whether to prefix or append the Paulis on each Clifford.
            - paulirandomize : bool. Whether to follow each layer in the Clifford circuit with a
                random Pauli on each qubit (compiled into native gates). I.e., if this is True the
                native gates are Pauli-randomized. When True, this prevents any coherent errors adding
                (on average) inside the layers of each compiled Clifford, at the cost of increased
                circuit depth. Defaults to False.
        For more information on these options, see the compile_clifford() docstring.

    descriptor : str, optional
        A string describing the experiment generated, which will be stored in the returned
        dictionary.

    add_default_protocol : bool, optional
        Whether to add a default RB protocol to the experiment design, which can be run
        later (once data is taken) by using a :class:`DefaultProtocolRunner` object.

    seed : int, optional
        A seed to initialize the random number generator used for creating random clifford
        circuits.

    verbosity : int, optional
        If > 0 the number of circuits generated so far is shown.

    Experiment design for Direct randomized benchmarking.

    This encapsulates a "direct randomized benchmarking" (DRB) experiments.  DRB was a protocol
    introduced in arXiv:1807.07975 (2018).

    An n-qubit DRB circuit consists of (1) a circuit the prepares a uniformly random stabilizer state;
    (2) a length-l circuit (specified by `length`) consisting of circuit layers sampled according to
    some user-specified distribution (specified by `sampler`), (3) a circuit that maps the output of
    the preceeding circuit to a computational basis state. See arXiv:1807.07975 (2018) for further
    details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pspec : QubitProcessorSpec
       The QubitProcessorSpec for the device that the circuit is being sampled for, which defines the
       "native" gate-set and the connectivity of the device. The returned DRB circuit will be over
       the gates in `pspec`, and will respect the connectivity encoded by `pspec`. Note that `pspec`
       is always handed to the sampler, as the first argument of the sampler function (this is only
       of importance when not using an in-built sampler for the "core" of the DRB circuit). Unless
       `qubit_labels` is not None, the circuit is sampled over all the qubits in `pspec`.

    depths : int
        The set of "direct RB depths" for the circuits. The DRB depths must be integers >= 0.
        Unless `addlocal` is True, the DRB length is the depth of the "core" random circuit,
        sampled according to `sampler`, specified in step (2) above. If `addlocal` is True,
        each layer in the "core" circuit sampled according to "sampler` is followed by a layer of
        1-qubit gates, with sampling specified by `lsargs` (and the first layer is proceeded by a
        layer of 1-qubit gates), and so the circuit of step (2) is length 2*`length` + 1.

    circuits_per_depth : int
        The number of (possibly) different DRB circuits sampled at each length.

    qubit_labels : list, optional
        If not None, a list of the qubits to sample the circuit for. This is a subset of
        `pspec.qubit_labels`. If None, the circuit is sampled to act on all the qubits
        in `pspec`.

    sampler : str or function, optional
        If a string, this should be one of:
            {'edgegrab', pairingQs', 'Qelimination', 'co2Qgates', 'local'}.
        Except for 'local', this corresponds to sampling layers according to the sampling function
        in rb.sampler named circuit_layer_by_* (with * replaced by 'sampler'). For 'local', this
        corresponds to sampling according to rb.sampler.circuit_layer_of_oneQgates [which is not
        a valid form of sampling for n-qubit DRB, but is not explicitly forbidden in this function].
        If `sampler` is a function, it should be a function that takes as the first argument a
        QubitProcessorSpec, and returns a random circuit layer as a list of gate Label objects. Note that
        the default 'Qelimination' is not necessarily the most useful in-built sampler, but it is the
        only sampler that requires no parameters beyond the QubitProcessorSpec *and* works for arbitrary
        connectivity devices. See the docstrings for each of these samplers for more information.

    samplerargs : list, optional
        A list of arguments that are handed to the sampler function, specified by `sampler`.
        The first argument handed to the sampler is `pspec`, the second argument is `qubit_labels`,
        and `samplerargs` lists the remaining arguments handed to the sampler. This is not
        optional for some choices of `sampler`.

    addlocal : bool, optional
        Whether to follow each layer in the "core" circuits, sampled according to `sampler` with
        a layer of 1-qubit gates.

    lsargs : list, optional
        Only used if addlocal is True. A list of optional arguments handed to the 1Q gate
        layer sampler circuit_layer_by_oneQgate(). Specifies how to sample 1Q-gate layers.

    randomizeout : bool, optional
        If False, the ideal output of the circuits (the "success" or "survival" outcome) is the all-zeros
        bit string. If True, the ideal output of each circuit is randomized to a uniformly random bit-string.
        This setting is useful for, e.g., detecting leakage/loss/measurement-bias etc.

    cliffordtwirl : bool, optional
        Wether to begin the circuits with a sequence that generates a random stabilizer state. For
        standard DRB this should be set to True. There are a variety of reasons why it is better
        to have this set to True.

    conditionaltwirl : bool, optional
        DRB only requires that the initial/final sequences of step (1) and (3) create/measure
        a uniformly random / particular stabilizer state, rather than implement a particular unitary.
        step (1) and (3) can be achieved by implementing a uniformly random Clifford gate and the
        unique inversion Clifford, respectively. This is implemented if `conditionaltwirl` is False.
        However, steps (1) and (3) can be implemented much more efficiently than this: the sequences
        of (1) and (3) only need to map a particular input state to a particular output state,
        if `conditionaltwirl` is True this more efficient option is chosen -- this is option corresponds
        to "standard" DRB. (the term "conditional" refers to the fact that in this case we essentially
        implementing a particular Clifford conditional on a known input).

    citerations : int, optional
        Some of the stabilizer state / Clifford compilation algorithms in pyGSTi (including the default
        algorithms) are  randomized, and the lowest-cost circuit is chosen from all the circuits generated
        in the iterations of the algorithm. This is the number of iterations used. The time required to
        generate a DRB circuit is linear in `citerations`. Lower-depth / lower 2-qubit gate count
        compilations of steps (1) and (3) are important in order to successfully implement DRB on as many
        qubits as possible.

    compilerargs : list, optional
        A list of arguments that are handed to the compile_stabilier_state/measurement()functions (or the
        compile_clifford() function if `conditionaltwirl `is False). This includes all the optional
        arguments of these functions *after* the `iterations` option (set by `citerations`). For most
        purposes the default options will be suitable (or at least near-optimal from the compilation methods
        in-built into pyGSTi). See the docstrings of these functions for more information.

    partitioned : bool, optional
        If False, each circuit is returned as a single full circuit. If True, each circuit is returned as
        a list of three circuits consisting of: (1) the stabilizer-prep circuit, (2) the core random circuit,
        (3) the pre-measurement circuit. In that case the full circuit is obtained by appended (2) to (1)
        and then (3) to (1).

    descriptor : str, optional
        A description of the experiment being generated. Stored in the output dictionary.

    add_default_protocol : bool, optional
        Whether to add a default RB protocol to the experiment design, which can be run
        later (once data is taken) by using a :class:`DefaultProtocolRunner` object.

    seed : int, optional
        A seed to initialize the random number generator used for creating random clifford
        circuits.

    verbosity : int, optional
        If > 0 the number of circuits generated so far is shown.

        some user-specified distribution (specified by `sampler`), (3) a circuit that maps the output of

        details.

        Parameters
        ----------
        pspec : QubitProcessorSpec
           The QubitProcessorSpec for the device that the circuit is being sampled for, which defines the
           "native" gate-set and the connectivity of the device. The returned DRB circuit will be over
           the gates in `pspec`, and will respect the connectivity encoded by `pspec`. Note that `pspec`
           is always handed to the sampler, as the first argument of the sampler function (this is only
           of importance when not using an in-built sampler for the "core" of the DRB circuit). Unless
           `qubit_labels` is not None, the circuit is sampled over all the qubits in `pspec`.

        depths : int
            The set of "direct RB depths" for the circuits. The DRB depths must be integers >= 0.
            Unless `addlocal` is True, the DRB length is the depth of the "core" random circuit,
            sampled according to `sampler`, specified in step (2) above. If `addlocal` is True,
            each layer in the "core" circuit sampled according to "sampler` is followed by a layer of
            1-qubit gates, with sampling specified by `lsargs` (and the first layer is proceeded by a
            layer of 1-qubit gates), and so the circuit of step (2) is length 2*`length` + 1.

        circuits_per_depth : int
            The number of (possibly) different DRB circuits sampled at each length.

        qubit_labels : list, optional

            and `samplerargs` lists the remaining arguments handed to the sampler. This is not
            optional for some choices of `sampler`.

        addlocal : bool, optional
            Whether to follow each layer in the "core" circuits, sampled according to `sampler` with
            a layer of 1-qubit gates.

        lsargs : list, optional
            Only used if addlocal is True. A list of optional arguments handed to the 1Q gate

        seed : int, optional
            A seed to initialize the random number generator used for creating random clifford
            circuits. The seed is incremented for each circuit sampled to ensure deterministic
            sampling even when using multiprocessing for parallelization. If None, a random

class MirrorRBDesign(_vb.BenchmarkingDesign):
    """
    Experiment design for mirror randomized benchmarking.

    Encapsulates a "mirror randomized benchmarking" (MRB) experiment, for the case of Clifford gates and with
    the option of Pauli randomization and local Clifford twirling. To implement mirror RB it is necessary
    for U^(-1) to in the gate set for every gate U in the gate set.

    **THIS METHOD IS IN DEVELOPEMENT. DO NOT EXPECT THAT THIS FUNCTION WILL BEHAVE THE SAME IN FUTURE RELEASES
    OF PYGSTI!**

    Parameters
    ----------
    pspec : QubitProcessorSpec
       The QubitProcessorSpec for the device that the experiment is being generated for. The `pspec` is always
       handed to the sampler, as the first argument of the sampler function.

    depths : list of ints
        The "mirror RB depths" of the circuits, which is closely related to the circuit depth. A MRB
        length must be an even integer, and can be zero.

        - If `localclifford` and `paulirandomize` are False, the depth of a sampled circuit = the MRB length.
          The first length/2 layers are all sampled independently according to the sampler specified by
          `sampler`. The remaining half of the circuit is the "inversion" circuit that is determined
          by the first half.

        - If `paulirandomize` is True and `localclifford` is False, the depth of a circuit is
          2*length+1 with odd-indexed layers sampled according to the sampler specified by `sampler, and
          the the zeroth layer + the even-indexed layers consisting of random 1-qubit Pauli gates.

        - If `paulirandomize` and `localclifford` are True, the depth of a circuit is
          2*length+1 + X where X is a random variable (between 0 and normally <= ~12-16) that accounts for
          the depth from the layer of random 1-qubit Cliffords at the start and end of the circuit.

        - If `paulirandomize` is False and `localclifford` is True, the depth of a circuit is
          length + X where X is a random variable (between 0 and normally <= ~12-16) that accounts for
          the depth from the layer of random 1-qubit Cliffords at the start and end of the circuit.

    circuits_per_depth : int
        The number of (possibly) different MRB circuits sampled at each length.

    qubit_labels : list, optional
        If not None, a list of the qubits that the RB circuit is to be sampled for. This should
        be all or a subset of the qubits in the device specified by the QubitProcessorSpec `pspec`.
        If None, it is assumed that the RB circuit should be over all the qubits. Note that the
        ordering of this list is the order of the ``wires'' in the returned circuit, but is otherwise
        irrelevant.

    sampler : str or function, optional
        If a string, this should be one of: {'pairingQs', 'Qelimination', 'co2Qgates', 'local'}.
        Except for 'local', this corresponds to sampling layers according to the sampling function
        in rb.sampler named circuit_layer_by* (with * replaced by 'sampler'). For 'local', this
        corresponds to sampling according to rb.sampler.circuit_layer_of_oneQgates [which is not
        a valid option for n-qubit MRB -- it results in sim. 1-qubit MRB -- but it is not explicitly
        forbidden by this function]. If `sampler` is a function, it should be a function that takes
        as the first argument a QubitProcessorSpec, and returns a random circuit layer as a list of gate
        Label objects. Note that the default 'Qelimination' is not necessarily the most useful
        in-built sampler, but it is the only sampler that requires no parameters beyond the QubitProcessorSpec
        *and* works for arbitrary connectivity devices. See the docstrings for each of these samplers
        for more information.

    samplerargs : list, optional
        A list of arguments that are handed to the sampler function, specified by `sampler`.
        The first argument handed to the sampler is `pspec` and `samplerargs` lists the
        remaining arguments handed to the sampler.

    localclifford : bool, optional
        Whether to start the circuit with uniformly random 1-qubit Cliffords and all of the
        qubits (compiled into the native gates of the device).

    paulirandomize : bool, optional
        Whether to have uniformly random Pauli operators on all of the qubits before and
        after all of the layers in the "out" and "back" random circuits. At length 0 there
        is a single layer of random Pauli operators (in between two layers of 1-qubit Clifford
        gates if `localclifford` is True); at length l there are 2l+1 Pauli layers as there
        are

    descriptor : str, optional
        A string describing the generated experiment. Stored in the returned dictionary.

    add_default_protocol : bool, optional
        Whether to add a default RB protocol to the experiment design, which can be run
        later (once data is taken) by using a :class:`DefaultProtocolRunner` object.
