        """
        # todo : update.

        Initialize an RB summary dataset.

        Parameters
        ----------
        number_of_qubits : int
            The number of qubits the dataset is for. This should be the number of qubits the RB experiments where
            "holistically" performed on. So, this dataset type is not suitable for, e.g., a *full* set of simultaneous
            RB data, which consists of parallel RB on different qubits. Data of that sort can be input into
            multiple RBSummaryDataset objects.

        lengths : list of ints
            A list of the "RB lengths" that the data is for. I.e., these are the "m" values in Pm = A + Bp^m.
            E.g., for direct RB this should be the number of circuit layers of native gates in the "core" circuit
            (i.e., not including the prep/measure stabilizer circuits). For Clifford RB this should be the number of
            Cliffords in the circuit (+ an arbitrary constant, traditionally -1, but -2 is more consistent with
            direct RB and is the pyGSTi convention for generating CRB circuits) *before* it is compiled into the
            native gates. This can always be the length value used to generate the circuit, if a pyGSTi RB
            circuit/experiment generation function was used to generate the circuit.

            This list should be the same length as the input results data (e.g., `success_counts` below). If
            `sortedinput` is False (the default), it is a list that has an entry for each circuit run (so values
            can appear multiple times in the list and in any order). If `sortedinput` is True is an ordered list
            containing each and every RB length once.

        success_counts : list of ints, or list of list of ints, optional
            Success counts, i.e., the number of times a circuit returns the "success" result. Normally this
            should be a list containing ints with `success_counts[i]` containing the success counts for a circuit
            with RB length `length[i]`. This is the case when `sortedinput` is False. But, if  `sortedinput` is
            True, it is instead a list of lists of ints: the list at `success_counts[i]` contains the data for
            all circuits with RB length `lengths[i]` (in this case `lengths` is an ordered list containing each
            RB length once). `success_counts` can be None, and the data can instead be specified via
            `success_probabilities`. But, inputing the data as success counts is the preferred option for
            experimental data.

        total_counts : int, or list of ints, or list of list of ints, optional
            If not None, an int that specifies the total number of counts per circuit *or* a list that specifies
            the total counts for each element in success_counts (or success_probabilities). This is *not* optional
            if success_counts is provided, and should always be specified with experimental data.

        success_probabilities : list of floats, or list of list of floats, optional
            The same as `success_counts` except that this list specifies observed survival probabilities, rather
            than the number of success counts. Can only be specified if `success_counts` is None, and it is better
            to input experimental data as `success_counts` (but this option is useful for finite-sampling-free
            simulated data).

        circuit_depths : list of ints, or list of list of ints, optional
            Has same format has `success_counts` or `success_probabilities`. Contains circuit depths. This is
            additional auxillary information that it is often useful to have when analyzing data from any type
            of RB that includes any compilation (e.g., Clifford RB). But this is not essential.

        circuit_twoQgate_counts : list of ints, or list of list of ints, optional
            Has same format has `success_counts` or `success_probabilities`. Contains circuit 2-qubit gate counts.
            This is additional auxillary information that it is often useful for interpretting RB results.

        descriptor :  str, optional
            A string that describes what the data is for.
