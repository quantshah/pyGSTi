    """
    Creates a circuit by randomply placing 2-qubit gates on qubit pairs.

    Samples a random circuit layer by pairing up qubits and picking a two-qubit gate for a pair
    with the specificed probability. This sampler *assumes* all-to-all connectivity, and does
    not check that this condition is satisfied (more generally, it assumes that all gates can be
    applied in parallel in any combination that would be well-defined).

    The sampler works as follows: If there are an odd number of qubits, one qubit is chosen at
    random to have a uniformly random 1-qubit gate applied to it (from all possible 1-qubit gates,
    or those in `one_q_gate_names` if not None). Then, the remaining qubits are paired up, uniformly
    at random. A uniformly random 2-qubit gate is then chosen for a pair with probability `two_q_prob`
    (from all possible 2-qubit gates, or those in `two_q_gate_names` if not None). If a 2-qubit gate
    is not chosen to act on a pair, then each qubit is independently and uniformly randomly assigned
    a 1-qubit gate.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pspec : QubitProcessorSpec
        The QubitProcessorSpec for the device that the circuit layer is being sampled for. This
        function assumes all-to-all connectivity, but does not check this is satisfied. Unless
        `qubit_labels` is not None, a circuit layer is sampled over all the qubits in `pspec`.

    qubit_labels : list, optional
        If not None, a list of the qubits to sample the circuit layer for. This is a subset of
        `pspec.qubit_labels`. If None, the circuit layer is sampled to acton all the qubits
        in `pspec`.

    two_q_prob : float, optional
        A probability for a two-qubit gate to be applied to a pair of qubits. So, the expected
        number of 2-qubit gates in the sampled layer is two_q_prob*floor(n/2).

    one_q_gate_names : 'all' or list, optional
        If not 'all', a list of the names of the 1-qubit gates to be sampled from when applying
        a 1-qubit gate to a qubit. If this is 'all', the full set of 1-qubit gate names is extracted
        from the QubitProcessorSpec.

    two_q_gate_names : 'all' or list, optional
        If not 'all', a list of the names of the 2-qubit gates to be sampled from when applying
        a 2-qubit gate to a pair of qubits. If this is 'all', the full set of 2-qubit gate names is
        extracted from the QubitProcessorSpec.

    modelname : str, optional
        Only used if one_q_gate_names or two_q_gate_names is None. Specifies which of the
        `pspec.models` to use to extract the gate-set. The `clifford` default is suitable
        for Clifford or direct RB, but will not use any non-Clifford gates in the gate-set.

    rand_state: RandomState, optional
        A np.random.RandomState object for seeding RNG

    Returns
    -------
    list of Labels

    Samples a random circuit layer by eliminating qubits one by one.

    This sampler works with any connectivity, but the expected number of 2-qubit gates
    in a layer depends on both the specified 2-qubit gate probability and the exact
    connectivity graph.

    This sampler is the following algorithm: List all the qubits, and repeat the
    following steps until all qubits are deleted from this list. 1) Uniformly at random
    pick a qubit from the list, and delete it from the list 2) Flip a coin with  bias
    `two_q_prob` to be "Heads". 3) If "Heads" then -- if there is one or more 2-qubit gates
    from this qubit to other qubits still in the list -- pick one of these at random.
    4) If we haven't chosen a 2-qubit gate for this qubit ("Tails" or "Heads" but there
    are no possible 2-qubit gates) then pick a uniformly random 1-qubit gate to apply to
    this qubit.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pspec : QubitProcessorSpec
        The QubitProcessorSpec for the device that the circuit layer is being sampled for. Unless
        `qubit_labels` is not None, a circuit layer is sampled over all the qubits in `pspec`.

    qubit_labels : list, optional
        If not None, a list of the qubits to sample the circuit layer for. This is a subset of
        `pspec.qubit_labels`. If None, the circuit layer is sampled to acton all the qubits
        in `pspec`.

    two_q_prob : float or None, optional
        None or a probability for a two-qubit gate to be applied to a pair of qubits. If
        None, sampling is uniform over all gates available on a qubit. If a float, if a
        2-qubit can is still possible on a qubit at that stage of the sampling, this is
        the probability a 2-qubit gate is chosen for that qubit. The expected number of
        2-qubit gates per layer depend on this quantity and the connectivity graph of
        the device.

    one_q_gates : 'all' or list, optional
        If not 'all', a list of the 1-qubit gates to sample from, in the form of Label
        objects. This is *not* just gate names (e.g. "Gh"), but Labels each containing
        the gate name and the qubit it acts on. So it is possible to specify different
        1-qubit models on different qubits. If this is 'all', the full set of possible
        1-qubit gates is extracted from the QubitProcessorSpec.

    two_q_gates : 'all' or list, optional
        If not 'all', a list of the 2-qubit gates to sample from, in the form of Label
        objects. This is *not* just gate names (e.g. "Gcnot"), but Labels each containing
        the gate name and the qubits it acts on. If this is 'all', the full set of possible
        2-qubit gates is extracted from the QubitProcessorSpec.

    modelname : str, optional
        Only used if one_q_gate_names or two_q_gate_names is None. Specifies the which of the
        `pspec.models` to use to extract the model. The `clifford` default is suitable
        for Clifford or direct RB, but will not use any non-Clifford gates in the model.

    rand_state: RandomState, optional
        A np.random.RandomState object for seeding RNG

    Returns
    -------
    list of gates
        A list of gate Labels that defines a "complete" circuit layer (there is one and

    """
    Samples a random circuit layer using the specified list of "compatible two-qubit gates" (co2_q_gates).

    That is, the user inputs a list (`co2_q_gates`) specifying 2-qubit gates that are
    "compatible" -- meaning that they can be implemented simulatenously -- and a distribution
    over the different compatible sets, and a layer is sampled from this via:

    1. Pick a set of compatible two-qubit gates from the list `co2_q_gates`, according to the
    distribution specified by `co2_q_gates_prob`.
    2. For each 2-qubit gate in the chosen set of compatible gates, with probability `two_q_prob`
    add this gate to the layer.
    3. Uniformly sample 1-qubit gates for any qubits that don't yet have a gate on them,
    from those 1-qubit gates specified by `one_q_gate_names`.

    For example, consider 4 qubits with linear connectivity. a valid `co2_q_gates` list is
    co2_q_gates = [[,],[Label(Gcphase,(0,1)),Label(Gcphase,(2,3))]] which consists of an
    element containing zero 2-qubit gates and an element containing  two 2-qubit gates
    that can be applied in parallel. In this example there are 5 possible sets of compatible
    2-qubit gates:

    1. [,] (zero 2-qubit gates)
    2. [Label(Gcphase,(0,1)),] (one of the three 2-qubit gate)
    3. [Label(Gcphase,(1,2)),] (one of the three 2-qubit gate)
    4. [Label(Gcphase,(2,3)),] (one of the three 2-qubit gate)
    5. [Label(Gcphase,(0,1)), Label(Gcphase,(2,3)),] (the only compatible pair of 2-qubit gates).

    The list of compatible two-qubit gates `co2_q_gates` can be any list containing anywhere
    from 1 to all 5 of these lists.

    In order to allow for convenient sampling of some commonly useful distributions,
    `co2_q_gates` can be a list of lists of lists of compatible 2-qubit gates ("nested" sampling).
    In this case, a list of lists of compatible 2-qubit gates is picked according to the distribution
    `co2_q_gates_prob`, and then one of the sublists of compatible 2-qubit gates in the selected list is
    then chosen uniformly at random. For example, this is useful for sampling a layer containing one
    uniformly random 2-qubit gate with probability p and a layer of 1-qubit gates with probability
    1-p. Here, we can specify `co2_q_gates` as [[],[[the 1st 2Q-gate,],[the 2nd 2Q-gate,], ...]] and
    set `two_q_prob=1` and `co2_q_gates_prob  = [1-p,p].

    Parameters
    ----------
    pspec : QubitProcessorSpec
        The QubitProcessorSpec for the device that the circuit layer is being sampled for. Unless
        `qubit_labels` is not None, a circuit layer is sampled over all the qubits in `pspec`.

    qubit_labels : list
        If not None, a list of the qubits to sample the circuit layer for. This is a subset of
        `pspec.qubit_labels`. If None, the circuit layer is sampled to act on all the qubits
        in `pspec`.

    co2_q_gates : list
        This is either:

            1. A list of lists of 2-qubit gate Labels that can be applied in parallel.
            2. A list of lists of lists of 2-qubit gate Labels that can be applied in parallel.

        In case (1) each list in `co2_q_gates` should contain 2-qubit gates, in the form of Labels,
        that can be applied in parallel and act only on the qubits in `pspec` if `qubit_labels` is None,
        or act only on the qubits in  `qubit_labels` if `qubit_labels` is not None.  The sampler then picks
        one of these compatible sets of gates (with probability specified by `co2_q_gates_prob`, and converts
        this into a circuit layer by applying the 2-qubit gates it contains with the user-specified
        probability `two_q_prob`, and augmenting these 2-qubit gates with 1-qubit gates on all other qubits.

        In case (2) a sublist of lists is sampled from `co2_q_gates` according to `co2_q_gates_prob` and then we
        proceed as in case (1) but as though `co2_q_gates_prob` is the uniform distribution.

    co2_q_gates_prob : str or list of floats
        If a list, they are unnormalized probabilities to sample each of the elements of `co2_q_gates`. So it
        is a list of non-negative floats of the same length as `co2_q_gates`. If 'uniform', then the uniform
        distribution is used.

    two_q_prob : float, optional
        The probability for each two-qubit gate to be applied to a pair of qubits, after a
        set of compatible 2-qubit gates has been chosen. The expected number of 2-qubit
        gates in a layer is `two_q_prob` times the expected number of 2-qubit gates in a
        set of compatible 2-qubit gates sampled according to `co2_q_gates_prob`.

    one_q_gate_names : 'all' or list of strs, optional
        If not 'all', a list of the names of the 1-qubit gates to be sampled from when applying
        a 1-qubit gate to a qubit. If this is 'all', the full set of 1-qubit gate names is
        extracted from the QubitProcessorSpec.

    rand_state: RandomState, optional
        A np.random.RandomState object for seeding RNG

    Returns
    -------
    list of gates
        A list of gate Labels that defines a "complete" circuit layer (there is one and
        only one gate acting on each qubit).

    """
    Samples a random circuit of the specified length (or ~ twice this length).

    The created circuit's layers are independently sampled according to the specified
    sampling distribution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pspec : QubitProcessorSpec
        The QubitProcessorSpec for the device that the circuit is being sampled for. This is always
        handed to the sampler, as the first argument of the sampler function. Unless
        `qubit_labels` is not None, the circuit is sampled over all the qubits in `pspec`.

    length : int
        If `addlocal` is False, this is the length of the sampled circuit. If `addlocal is
        True the length of the circuits is 2*length+1 with odd-indexed layers sampled according
        to the sampler specified by `sampler`, and the the zeroth layer + the even-indexed
        layers consisting of random 1-qubit gates (with the sampling specified by `lsargs`)

    qubit_labels : list, optional
        If not None, a list of the qubits to sample the circuit for. This is a subset of
        `pspec.qubit_labels`. If None, the circuit is sampled to act on all the qubits
        in `pspec`.

    sampler : str or function, optional
        If a string, this should be one of: {'pairingQs', 'Qelimination', 'co2Qgates', 'local'}.
        Except for 'local', this corresponds to sampling layers according to the sampling function
        in rb.sampler named circuit_layer_by* (with * replaced by 'sampler'). For 'local', this
        corresponds to sampling according to rb.sampler.circuit_layer_of_oneQgates. If this is a
        function, it should be a function that takes as the first argument a QubitProcessorSpec, and
        returns a random circuit layer as a list of gate Label objects. Note that the default
        'Qelimination' is not necessarily the most useful in-built sampler, but it is the only
        sampler that requires no parameters beyond the QubitProcessorSpec *and* works for arbitrary
        connectivity devices. See the docstrings for each of these samplers for more information.

    samplerargs : list, optional
        A list of arguments that are handed to the sampler function, specified by `sampler`.
        The first argument handed to the sampler is `pspec` and `samplerargs` lists the
        remaining arguments handed to the sampler. For some in-built samplers this is not
        optional.

    addlocal : bool, optional
        If False, the circuit sampled is of length `length` and each layer is independently
        sampled according to the sampler specified by `sampler`. If True, the circuit sampled
        is of length 2*`length`+1 where: the zeroth + all even layers are consisting of
        independently random 1-qubit gates (with the sampling specified by `lsargs`); the
        odd-indexed layers are independently sampled according to `sampler`. So `length`+1
        layers consist only of 1-qubit gates, and `length` layers are sampled according to
        `sampler`.

    lsargs : list, optional
        A list of arguments that are handed to the 1-qubit gate layers sampler
        rb.sampler.circuit_layer_of_oneQgates for the alternating 1-qubit-only layers that are
        included in the circuit if `addlocal` is True. This argument is not used if `addlocal`
        is false. Note that `pspec` is used as the first, and only required, argument of
        rb.sampler.circuit_layer_of_oneQgates. If `lsargs` = [] then all available 1-qubit gates
        are uniformly sampled from. To uniformly sample from only a subset of the available
        1-qubit gates (e.g., the Paulis to Pauli-frame-randomize) then `lsargs` should be a
        1-element list consisting of a list of the relevant gate names (e.g., `lsargs` = ['Gi,
        'Gxpi, 'Gypi', 'Gzpi']).

    rand_state: RandomState, optional
        A np.random.RandomState object for seeding RNG

        Except for 'local', this corresponds to sampling layers according to the sampling function
        in rb.sampler named circuit_layer_by* (with * replaced by 'sampler'). For 'local', this
        corresponds to sampling according to rb.sampler.circuit_layer_of_oneQgates.
        If `sampler` is a function, it should be a function that takes as the first argument a
        QubitProcessorSpec, and returns a random circuit layer as a list of gate Label objects. Note that
        the default 'Qelimination' is not necessarily the most useful in-built sampler, but it is
        the only sampler that requires no parameters beyond the QubitProcessorSpec *and* works for arbitrary
        connectivity devices. See the docstrings for each of these samplers for more information.

    samplerargs : list, optional
        A list of arguments that are handed to the sampler function, specified by `sampler`.
        The first argument handed to the sampler is `pspec`, the second argument is `qubit_labels`,
        and `samplerargs` lists the remaining arguments handed to the sampler. This is not
        optional for some choices of `sampler`.

    addlocal : bool, optional
        Whether to follow each layer in the circuit, sampled according to `sampler` with
        a layer of 1-qubit gates. If this is True then the length of the circuit is double
        the requested length.

    lsargs : list, optional
        Only used if addlocal is True. A list of optional arguments handed to the 1Q gate
        layer sampler circuit_layer_by_oneQgate(). Specifies how to sample 1Q-gate layers.

    set_isolated : bool, optional
        Todo

    TODO: update docstring - add clifford compilations and modify pspec -- same with other create_ fns in this module
    Generates a "direct randomized benchmarking" (DRB) circuit.

    DRB is the protocol introduced in arXiv:1807.07975 (2018). The length of the "core" circuit is
    given by `length` and may be any integer >= 0. An n-qubit DRB circuit consists of (1) a circuit
    the prepares a uniformly random stabilizer state; (2) a length-l circuit (specified by `length`)
    consisting of circuit layers sampled according to some user-specified distribution (specified by
    `sampler`), (3) a circuit that maps the output of the preceeding circuit to a computational
    basis state. See arXiv:1807.07975 (2018) for further details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pspec : QubitProcessorSpec
        The QubitProcessorSpec for the device that the circuit is being sampled for, which defines the
        "native" gate-set and the connectivity of the device. The returned DRB circuit will be over
        the gates in `pspec`, and will respect the connectivity encoded by `pspec`. Note that `pspec`
        is always handed to the sampler, as the first argument of the sampler function (this is only
        of importance when not using an in-built sampler for the "core" of the DRB circuit). Unless
        `qubit_labels` is not None, the circuit is sampled over all the qubits in `pspec`.

    length : int
        The "direct RB length" of the circuit, which is closely related to the circuit depth. It
        must be an integer >= 0. Unless `addlocal` is True, it is the depth of the "core" random
        circuit, sampled according to `sampler`, specified in step (2) above. If `addlocal` is True,
        each layer in the "core" circuit sampled according to "sampler` is followed by a layer of
        1-qubit gates, with sampling specified by `lsargs` (and the first layer is proceeded by a
        layer of 1-qubit gates), and so the circuit of step (2) is length 2*`length` + 1.

    qubit_labels : list, optional
        If not None, a list of the qubits to sample the circuit for. This is a subset of
        `pspec.qubit_labels`. If None, the circuit is sampled to act on all the qubits
        in `pspec`.

    sampler : str or function, optional
        If a string, this should be one of: {'pairingQs', 'Qelimination', 'co2Qgates', 'local'}.
        Except for 'local', this corresponds to sampling layers according to the sampling function
        in rb.sampler named circuit_layer_by* (with * replaced by 'sampler'). For 'local', this
        corresponds to sampling according to rb.sampler.circuit_layer_of_oneQgates [which is not
        a valid form of sampling for n-qubit DRB, but is not explicitly forbidden in this function].
        If `sampler` is a function, it should be a function that takes as the first argument a
        QubitProcessorSpec, and returns a random circuit layer as a list of gate Label objects. Note that
        the default 'Qelimination' is not necessarily the most useful in-built sampler, but it is
        the only sampler that requires no parameters beyond the QubitProcessorSpec *and* works for arbitrary
        connectivity devices. See the docstrings for each of these samplers for more information.

    samplerargs : list, optional
        A list of arguments that are handed to the sampler function, specified by `sampler`.
        The first argument handed to the sampler is `pspec`, the second argument is `qubit_labels`,
        and `samplerargs` lists the remaining arguments handed to the sampler. This is not
        optional for some choices of `sampler`.

    addlocal : bool, optional
        Whether to follow each layer in the "core" circuit, sampled according to `sampler` with
        a layer of 1-qubit gates.

    lsargs : list, optional
        Only used if addlocal is True. A list of optional arguments handed to the 1Q gate
        layer sampler circuit_layer_by_oneQgate(). Specifies how to sample 1Q-gate layers.

    randomizeout : bool, optional
        If False, the ideal output of the circuit (the "success" or "survival" outcome) is the all-zeros
        bit string. If True, the ideal output of the circuit is randomized to a uniformly random bit-string.
        This setting is useful for, e.g., detecting leakage/loss/measurement-bias etc.

    cliffordtwirl : bool, optional
        Wether to begin the circuit with a sequence that generates a random stabilizer state. For
        standard DRB this should be set to True. There are a variety of reasons why it is better
        to have this set to True.

    conditionaltwirl : bool, optional
        DRB only requires that the initial/final sequences of step (1) and (3) create/measure
        a uniformly random / particular stabilizer state, rather than implement a particular unitary.
        step (1) and (3) can be achieved by implementing a uniformly random Clifford gate and the
        unique inversion Clifford, respectively. This is implemented if `conditionaltwirl` is False.
        However, steps (1) and (3) can be implemented much more efficiently than this: the sequences
        of (1) and (3) only need to map a particular input state to a particular output state,
        if `conditionaltwirl` is True this more efficient option is chosen -- this is option corresponds
        to "standard" DRB. (the term "conditional" refers to the fact that in this case we essentially
        implementing a particular Clifford conditional on a known input).

    citerations : int, optional
        Some of the stabilizer state / Clifford compilation algorithms in pyGSTi (including the default
        algorithms) are  randomized, and the lowest-cost circuit is chosen from all the circuit generated
        in the iterations of the algorithm. This is the number of iterations used. The time required to
        generate a DRB circuit is linear in `citerations`. Lower-depth / lower 2-qubit gate count
        compilations of steps (1) and (3) are important in order to successfully implement DRB on as many
        qubits as possible.

    compilerargs : list, optional
        A list of arguments that are handed to the compile_stabilier_state/measurement()functions (or the
        compile_clifford() function if `conditionaltwirl `is False). This includes all the optional
        arguments of these functions *after* the `iterations` option (set by `citerations`). For most
        purposes the default options will be suitable (or at least near-optimal from the compilation methods
        in-built into pyGSTi). See the docstrings of these functions for more information.

    partitioned : bool, optional
        If False, a single circuit is returned consisting of the full circuit. If True, three circuits
        are returned in a list consisting of: (1) the stabilizer-prep circuit, (2) the core random circuit,
        (3) the pre-measurement circuit. In that case the full circuit is obtained by appended (2) to (1)
        and then (3) to (1).

    seed : int, optional
        A seed to initialize the random number generator used for creating random clifford
        circuits.

    Returns
    -------
    Circuit or list of Circuits
        If partioned is False, a random DRB circuit sampled as specified. If partioned is True, a list of
        three circuits consisting of (1) the stabilizer-prep circuit, (2) the core random circuit,
        (3) the pre-measurement circuit. In that case the full circuit is obtained by appended (2) to (1)
        and then (3) to (1) [except in the case of cliffordtwirl=False, when it is a list of two circuits].
    Tuple
        A length-n tuple of integers in [0,1], corresponding to the error-free outcome of the
        circuit. Always all zeros if `randomizeout` is False. The ith element of the tuple
        corresponds to the error-free outcome for the qubit labelled by: the ith element of
        `qubit_labels`, if `qubit_labels` is not None; the ith element of `pspec.qubit_labels`, otherwise.
        In both cases, the ith element of the tuple corresponds to the error-free outcome for the
        qubit on the ith wire of the output circuit.

    Generates a simultaneous "direct randomized benchmarking" (DRB) circuit.

    (1) a circuit the prepares a uniformly random stabilizer state; (2) a length-l circuit

    what SDRB is.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pspec : QubitProcessorSpec
        The QubitProcessorSpec for the device that the circuit is being sampled for, which defines the
        "native" gate-set and the connectivity of the device. The returned DRB circuit will be over
        the gates in `pspec`, and will respect the connectivity encoded by `pspec`. Note that `pspec`
        is always handed to the sampler, as the first argument of the sampler function (this is only
        of importance when not using an in-built sampler for the "core" of the DRB circuit). Unless
        `qubit_labels` is not None, the circuit is sampled over all the qubits in `pspec`.

    length : int
        The "direct RB length" of the circuit, which is closely related to the circuit depth. It
        must be an integer >= 0. Unless `addlocal` is True, it is the depth of the "core" random
        circuit, sampled according to `sampler`, specified in step (2) above. If `addlocal` is True,
        each layer in the "core" circuit sampled according to "sampler` is followed by a layer of
        1-qubit gates, with sampling specified by `lsargs` (and the first layer is proceeded by a
        layer of 1-qubit gates), and so the circuit of step (2) is length 2*`length` + 1.

    structure : str or tuple, optional
        todo.

    sampler : str or function, optional
        If a string, this should be one of: {'pairingQs', 'Qelimination', 'co2Qgates', 'local'}.
        Except for 'local', this corresponds to sampling layers according to the sampling function
        in rb.sampler named circuit_layer_by* (with * replaced by 'sampler'). For 'local', this
        corresponds to sampling according to rb.sampler.circuit_layer_of_oneQgates [which is not
        a valid form of sampling for n-qubit DRB, but is not explicitly forbidden in this function].
        If `sampler` is a function, it should be a function that takes as the first argument a
        QubitProcessorSpec, and returns a random circuit layer as a list of gate Label objects. Note that
        the default 'Qelimination' is not necessarily the most useful in-built sampler, but it is
        the only sampler that requires no parameters beyond the QubitProcessorSpec *and* works for arbitrary
        connectivity devices. See the docstrings for each of these samplers for more information.

    samplerargs : list, optional
        A list of arguments that are handed to the sampler function, specified by `sampler`.
        The first argument handed to the sampler is `pspec`, the second argument is `qubit_labels`,
        and `samplerargs` lists the remaining arguments handed to the sampler. This is not
        optional for some choices of `sampler`.

    addlocal : bool, optional
        Whether to follow each layer in the "core" circuit, sampled according to `sampler` with
        a layer of 1-qubit gates.

    lsargs : list, optional
        Only used if addlocal is True. A list of optional arguments handed to the 1Q gate
        layer sampler circuit_layer_by_oneQgate(). Specifies how to sample 1Q-gate layers.

    randomizeout : bool, optional
        If False, the ideal output of the circuit (the "success" or "survival" outcome) is the all-zeros
        bit string. If True, the ideal output of the circuit is randomized to a uniformly random bit-string.
        This setting is useful for, e.g., detecting leakage/loss/measurement-bias etc.

    cliffordtwirl : bool, optional
        Wether to begin the circuit with a sequence that generates a random stabilizer state. For
        standard DRB this should be set to True. There are a variety of reasons why it is better
        to have this set to True.

    conditionaltwirl : bool, optional
        DRB only requires that the initial/final sequences of step (1) and (3) create/measure
        a uniformly random / particular stabilizer state, rather than implement a particular unitary.
        step (1) and (3) can be achieved by implementing a uniformly random Clifford gate and the
        unique inversion Clifford, respectively. This is implemented if `conditionaltwirl` is False.
        However, steps (1) and (3) can be implemented much more efficiently than this: the sequences
        of (1) and (3) only need to map a particular input state to a particular output state,
        if `conditionaltwirl` is True this more efficient option is chosen -- this is option corresponds
        to "standard" DRB. (the term "conditional" refers to the fact that in this case we essentially
        implementing a particular Clifford conditional on a known input).

    citerations : int, optional
        Some of the stabilizer state / Clifford compilation algorithms in pyGSTi (including the default
        algorithms) are  randomized, and the lowest-cost circuit is chosen from all the circuit generated
        in the iterations of the algorithm. This is the number of iterations used. The time required to
        generate a DRB circuit is linear in `citerations`. Lower-depth / lower 2-qubit gate count
        compilations of steps (1) and (3) are important in order to successfully implement DRB on as many
        qubits as possible.

    compilerargs : list, optional
        A list of arguments that are handed to the compile_stabilier_state/measurement()functions (or the
        compile_clifford() function if `conditionaltwirl `is False). This includes all the optional
        arguments of these functions *after* the `iterations` option (set by `citerations`). For most
        purposes the default options will be suitable (or at least near-optimal from the compilation methods
        in-built into pyGSTi). See the docstrings of these functions for more information.

    partitioned : bool, optional
        If False, a single circuit is returned consisting of the full circuit. If True, three circuits
        are returned in a list consisting of: (1) the stabilizer-prep circuit, (2) the core random circuit,
        (3) the pre-measurement circuit. In that case the full circuit is obtained by appended (2) to (1)
        and then (3) to (1).

    seed: int, optional
        Seed for RNG

    Returns
    -------
    Circuit or list of Circuits
        If partioned is False, a random DRB circuit sampled as specified. If partioned is True, a list of
        three circuits consisting of (1) the stabilizer-prep circuit, (2) the core random circuit,
        (3) the pre-measurement circuit. In that case the full circuit is obtained by appended (2) to (1)
        and then (3) to (1) [except in the case of cliffordtwirl=False, when it is a list of two circuits].
    Tuple
        A length-n tuple of integers in [0,1], corresponding to the error-free outcome of the
        circuit. Always all zeros if `randomizeout` is False. The ith element of the tuple
        corresponds to the error-free outcome for the qubit labelled by: the ith element of
        `qubit_labels`, if `qubit_labels` is not None; the ith element of `pspec.qubit_labels`, otherwise.
        In both cases, the ith element of the tuple corresponds to the error-free outcome for the
        qubit on the ith wire of the output circuit.

    """
    Generates a simultaneous "direct randomized benchmarking" (DRB) experiments (circuits).

    DRB is the protocol introduced in arXiv:1807.07975 (2018).
    An n-qubit DRB circuit consists of (1) a circuit the prepares a uniformly random stabilizer state;
    (2) a length-l circuit (specified by `length`) consisting of circuit layers sampled according to
    some user-specified distribution (specified by `sampler`), (3) a circuit that maps the output of
    the preceeding circuit to a computational basis state. See arXiv:1807.07975 (2018) for further
    details. In simultaneous DRB ...... <TODO more description>.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pspec : QubitProcessorSpec
        The QubitProcessorSpec for the device that the circuit is being sampled for, which defines the
        "native" gate-set and the connectivity of the device. The returned DRB circuit will be over
        the gates in `pspec`, and will respect the connectivity encoded by `pspec`. Note that `pspec`
        is always handed to the sampler, as the first argument of the sampler function (this is only
        of importance when not using an in-built sampler for the "core" of the DRB circuit). Unless
        `qubit_labels` is not None, the circuit is sampled over all the qubits in `pspec`.

    depths : int
        The set of "direct RB depths" for the circuits. The DRB depths must be integers >= 0.
        Unless `addlocal` is True, the DRB length is the depth of the "core" random circuit,
        sampled according to `sampler`, specified in step (2) above. If `addlocal` is True,
        each layer in the "core" circuit sampled according to "sampler` is followed by a layer of
        1-qubit gates, with sampling specified by `lsargs` (and the first layer is proceeded by a
        layer of 1-qubit gates), and so the circuit of step (2) is length 2*`length` + 1.

    circuits_per_length : int
        The number of (possibly) different DRB circuits sampled at each length.

    structure : str or tuple.
        Defines the "structure" of the simultaneous DRB experiment. TODO : more details.

    sampler : str or function, optional
        If a string, this should be one of: {'pairingQs', 'Qelimination', 'co2Qgates', 'local'}.
        Except for 'local', this corresponds to sampling layers according to the sampling function
        in rb.sampler named circuit_layer_by* (with * replaced by 'sampler'). For 'local', this
        corresponds to sampling according to rb.sampler.circuit_layer_of_oneQgates [which is not
        a valid form of sampling for n-qubit DRB, but is not explicitly forbidden in this function].
        If `sampler` is a function, it should be a function that takes as the first argument a
        QubitProcessorSpec, and returns a random circuit layer as a list of gate Label objects. Note that
        the default 'Qelimination' is not necessarily the most useful in-built sampler, but it is the
        only sampler that requires no parameters beyond the QubitProcessorSpec *and* works for arbitrary
        connectivity devices. See the docstrings for each of these samplers for more information.

    samplerargs : list, optional
        A list of arguments that are handed to the sampler function, specified by `sampler`.
        The first argument handed to the sampler is `pspec`, the second argument is `qubit_labels`,
        and `samplerargs` lists the remaining arguments handed to the sampler. This is not
        optional for some choices of `sampler`.

    addlocal : bool, optional
        Whether to follow each layer in the "core" circuits, sampled according to `sampler` with
        a layer of 1-qubit gates.

    lsargs : list, optional
        Only used if addlocal is True. A list of optional arguments handed to the 1Q gate
        layer sampler circuit_layer_by_oneQgate(). Specifies how to sample 1Q-gate layers.

    randomizeout : bool, optional
        If False, the ideal output of the circuits (the "success" or "survival" outcome) is the all-zeros
        bit string. If True, the ideal output of each circuit is randomized to a uniformly random bit-string.
        This setting is useful for, e.g., detecting leakage/loss/measurement-bias etc.

    cliffordtwirl : bool, optional
        Wether to begin the circuit with a sequence that generates a random stabilizer state. For
        standard DRB this should be set to True. There are a variety of reasons why it is better
        to have this set to True.

    conditionaltwirl : bool, optional
        DRB only requires that the initial/final sequences of step (1) and (3) create/measure
        a uniformly random / particular stabilizer state, rather than implement a particular unitary.
        step (1) and (3) can be achieved by implementing a uniformly random Clifford gate and the
        unique inversion Clifford, respectively. This is implemented if `conditionaltwirl` is False.
        However, steps (1) and (3) can be implemented much more efficiently than this: the sequences
        of (1) and (3) only need to map a particular input state to a particular output state,
        if `conditionaltwirl` is True this more efficient option is chosen -- this is option corresponds
        to "standard" DRB. (the term "conditional" refers to the fact that in this case we essentially
        implementing a particular Clifford conditional on a known input).

    citerations : int, optional
        Some of the stabilizer state / Clifford compilation algorithms in pyGSTi (including the default
        algorithms) are  randomized, and the lowest-cost circuit is chosen from all the circuits generated
        in the iterations of the algorithm. This is the number of iterations used. The time required to
        generate a DRB circuit is linear in `citerations`. Lower-depth / lower 2-qubit gate count
        compilations of steps (1) and (3) are important in order to successfully implement DRB on as many
        qubits as possible.

    compilerargs : list, optional
        A list of arguments that are handed to the compile_stabilier_state/measurement()functions (or the
        compile_clifford() function if `conditionaltwirl `is False). This includes all the optional
        arguments of these functions *after* the `iterations` option (set by `citerations`). For most
        purposes the default options will be suitable (or at least near-optimal from the compilation methods
        in-built into pyGSTi). See the docstrings of these functions for more information.

    partitioned : bool, optional
        If False, each circuit is returned as a single full circuit. If True, each circuit is returned as
        a list of three circuits consisting of: (1) the stabilizer-prep circuit, (2) the core random circuit,
        (3) the pre-measurement circuit. In that case the full circuit is obtained by appended (2) to (1)
        and then (3) to (1).

    set_isolated : bool, optional
        Todo

    setcomplement_isolated : bool, optional
        Todo

    descriptor : str, optional
        A description of the experiment being generated. Stored in the output dictionary.

    verbosity : int, optional
        If > 0 the number of circuits generated so far is shown.

    seed: int, optional
        Seed for RNG

    Returns
    -------
    Circuit or list of Circuits
        If partioned is False, a random DRB circuit sampled as specified. If partioned is True, a list of
        three circuits consisting of (1) the stabilizer-prep circuit, (2) the core random circuit,
        (3) the pre-measurement circuit. In that case the full circuit is obtained by appended (2) to (1)
        and then (3) to (1).
    Tuple
        A length-n tuple of integers in [0,1], corresponding to the error-free outcome of the
        circuit. Always all zeros if `randomizeout` is False. The ith element of the tuple
        corresponds to the error-free outcome for the qubit labelled by: the ith element of
        `qubit_labels`, if `qubit_labels` is not None; the ith element of `pspec.qubit_labels`, otherwise.
        In both cases, the ith element of the tuple corresponds to the error-free outcome for the
        qubit on the ith wire of the output circuit.
    dict
        A dictionary containing the generated RB circuits, the error-free outputs of the circuit,
        and the specification used to generate the circuits. The keys are:

        - 'circuits'. A dictionary of the sampled circuits. The circuit with key(l,k) is the kth circuit
        at DRB length l.

        - 'idealout'. A dictionary of the error-free outputs of the circuits as tuples. The tuple with
        key(l,k) is the error-free output of the (l,k) circuit. The ith element of this tuple corresponds
        to the error-free outcome for the qubit on the ith wire of the output circuit and/or the ith element
        of the list at the key 'qubitordering'. These tuples will all be (0,0,0,...) when `randomizeout` is
        False

        - 'qubitordering'. The ordering of the qubits in the 'idealout' tuples.

        - 'spec'. A dictionary containing all of the parameters handed to this function, except `pspec`.
        This then specifies how the circuits where generated.

    """
    Generates a "Clifford randomized benchmarking" (CRB) circuit.

    CRB is the current-standard RB protocol defined in "Scalable and robust randomized benchmarking of quantum
    processes", Magesan et al. PRL 106 180504 (2011). This consists of a circuit of `length`+1 uniformly
    random n-qubit Clifford gates followed by the unique inversion Clifford, with all the Cliffords compiled
    into the "native" gates of a device as specified by `pspec`. The circuit output by this function will
    respect the connectivity of the device, as encoded into `pspec` (see the QubitProcessorSpec object docstring
    for how to construct the relevant `pspec`).

    Note the convention that the the output Circuit consists of `length+2` Clifford gates, rather than the
    more usual convention of defining the "CRB length" to be the number of Clifford gates - 1. This is for
    consistency with the other RB functions in pyGSTi: in all RB-circuit-generating functions in pyGSTi
    length zero corresponds to the minimum-length circuit allowed by the protocol. Note that changing the
    "RB depths" by a constant additive factor is irrelevant for fitting purposes (except that it changes
    the obtained "SPAM" fit parameter).

    Parameters
    ----------
    pspec : QubitProcessorSpec
        The QubitProcessorSpec for the device that the circuit is being sampled for, which defines the
        "native" gate-set and the connectivity of the device. The returned CRB circuit will be over
        the gates in `pspec`, and will respect the connectivity encoded by `pspec`.

    length : int
        The "CRB length" of the circuit -- an integer >= 0 --  which is the number of Cliffords in the
        circuit - 2 *before* each Clifford is compiled into the native gate-set.

    qubit_labels : list, optional
        If not None, a list of the qubits that the RB circuit is to be sampled for. This should
        be all or a subset of the qubits in the device specified by the QubitProcessorSpec `pspec`.
        If None, it is assumed that the RB circuit should be over all the qubits. Note that the
        ordering of this list is the order of the ``wires'' in the returned circuit, but is otherwise
        irrelevant. If desired, a circuit that explicitly idles on the other qubits can be obtained
        by using methods of the Circuit object.

    randomizeout : bool, optional
        If False, the ideal output of the circuit (the "success" or "survival" outcome) is the all-zeros
        bit string. This is probably considered to be the "standard" in CRB. If True, the ideal output
        of the circuit is randomized to a uniformly random bit-string. This setting is useful for, e.g.,
        detecting leakage/loss/measurement-bias etc.

    citerations : int, optional
        Some of the Clifford compilation algorithms in pyGSTi (including the default algorithm) are
        randomized, and the lowest-cost circuit is chosen from all the circuit generated in the
        iterations of the algorithm. This is the number of iterations used. The time required to
        generate a CRB circuit is linear in `citerations` * (`length`+2). Lower-depth / lower 2-qubit
        gate count compilations of the Cliffords are important in order to successfully implement
        CRB on more qubits.

    compilerargs : list, optional
        A list of arguments that are handed to compile_clifford() function, which includes all the
        optional arguments of compile_clifford() *after* the `iterations` option (set by `citerations`).
        In order, this list should be values for:
            - algorithm : str. A string that specifies the compilation algorithm. The default in
                compile_clifford() will always be whatever we consider to be the 'best' all-round
                algorith,
            - aargs : list. A list of optional arguments for the particular compilation algorithm.
            - costfunction : 'str' or function. The cost-function from which the "best" compilation
                for a Clifford is chosen from all `citerations` compilations. The default costs a
                circuit as 10x the num. of 2-qubit gates in the circuit + 1x the depth of the circuit.
            - prefixpaulis : bool. Whether to prefix or append the Paulis on each Clifford.
            - paulirandomize : bool. Whether to follow each layer in the Clifford circuit with a
                random Pauli on each qubit (compiled into native gates). I.e., if this is True the
                native gates are Pauli-randomized. When True, this prevents any coherent errors adding
                (on average) inside the layers of each compiled Clifford, at the cost of increased
                circuit depth. Defaults to False.
        For more information on these options, see the compile_clifford() docstring.

    seed : int, optional
        A seed to initialize the random number generator used for creating random clifford
        circuits.

    Returns
    -------
    Circuit
        A random CRB circuit over the "native" gate-set specified.
    Tuple
        A length-n tuple of integers in [0,1], corresponding to the error-free outcome of the
        circuit. Always all zeros if `randomizeout` is False. The ith element of the tuple
        corresponds to the error-free outcome for the qubit labelled by: the ith element of
        `qubit_labels`, if `qubit_labels` is not None; the ith element of `pspec.qubit_labels`, otherwise.
        In both cases, the ith element of the tuple corresponds to the error-free outcome for the
        qubit on the ith wire of the output circuit.

    """
    Generates a "mirror randomized benchmarking" (MRB) circuit.

    This is specific to the case of Clifford gates and can be performed, optionally, with Pauli-randomization
    and Clifford-twirling. This RB method is currently in development; this docstring will be updated in the
    future with further information on this technique.

    To implement mirror RB it is necessary for U^(-1) to in the gate-set for every U in the gate-set.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pspec : QubitProcessorSpec
        The QubitProcessorSpec for the device that the circuit is being sampled for. The `pspec` is always
        handed to the sampler, as the first argument of the sampler function.

    length : int
        The "mirror RB length" of the circuit, which is closely related to the circuit depth. It
        must be an even integer, and can be zero.

        - If `localclifford` and `paulirandomize` are False, this is the depth of the sampled circuit.
          The first length/2 layers are all sampled independently according to the sampler specified by
          `sampler`. The remaining half of the circuit is the "inversion" circuit that is determined
          by the first half.

        - If `paulirandomize` is True and `localclifford` is False, the depth of the circuits is
          2*length+1 with odd-indexed layers sampled according to the sampler specified by `sampler, and
          the the zeroth layer + the even-indexed layers consisting of random 1-qubit Pauli gates.

        - If `paulirandomize` and `localclifford` are True, the depth of the circuits is
          2*length+1 + X where X is a random variable (between 0 and normally <= ~12-16) that accounts for
          the depth from the layer of random 1-qubit Cliffords at the start and end of the circuit.

        - If `paulirandomize` is False and `localclifford` is True, the depth of the circuits is
          length + X where X is a random variable (between 0 and normally <= ~12-16) that accounts for
          the depth from the layer of random 1-qubit Cliffords at the start and end of the circuit.

    qubit_labels : list, optional
        If not None, a list of the qubits that the RB circuit is to be sampled for. This should
        be all or a subset of the qubits in the device specified by the QubitProcessorSpec `pspec`.
        If None, it is assumed that the RB circuit should be over all the qubits. Note that the
        ordering of this list is the order of the ``wires'' in the returned circuit, but is otherwise
        irrelevant.

    sampler : str or function, optional
        If a string, this should be one of: {'pairingQs', 'Qelimination', 'co2Qgates', 'local'}.
        Except for 'local', this corresponds to sampling layers according to the sampling function
        in rb.sampler named circuit_layer_by* (with * replaced by 'sampler'). For 'local', this
        corresponds to sampling according to rb.sampler.circuit_layer_of_oneQgates [which is not
        a valid option for n-qubit MRB -- it results in sim. 1-qubit MRB -- but it is not explicitly
        forbidden by this function]. If `sampler` is a function, it should be a function that takes
        as the first argument a QubitProcessorSpec, and returns a random circuit layer as a list of gate
        Label objects. Note that the default 'Qelimination' is not necessarily the most useful
        in-built sampler, but it is the only sampler that requires no parameters beyond the QubitProcessorSpec
        *and* works for arbitrary connectivity devices. See the docstrings for each of these samplers
        for more information.

    samplerargs : list, optional
        A list of arguments that are handed to the sampler function, specified by `sampler`.
        The first argument handed to the sampler is `pspec` and `samplerargs` lists the
        remaining arguments handed to the sampler.

    localclifford : bool, optional
        Whether to start the circuit with uniformly random 1-qubit Cliffords and all of the
        qubits (compiled into the native gates of the device).

    paulirandomize : bool, optional
        Whether to have uniformly random Pauli operators on all of the qubits before and
        after all of the layers in the "out" and "back" random circuits. At length 0 there
        is a single layer of random Pauli operators (in between two layers of 1-qubit Clifford
        gates if `localclifford` is True); at length l there are 2l+1 Pauli layers as there
        are

    seed : int, optional
        A seed to initialize the random number generator used for creating random clifford
        circuits.

    Returns
    -------
    Circuit
        A random MRB circuit, sampled as specified, of depth:

            - `length`, if not paulirandomize and not local clifford.
            - 2*`length`+1 if paulirandomize and not local clifford.
            - `length` + X, if not paulirandomize and local clifford, where X is a random variable
              that accounts for the depth from the layers of random 1-qubit Cliffords (X = 2 if the 1
              qubit Clifford gates are "native" gates in the QubitProcessorSpec).
            - 2*`length`+1 + X, if paulirandomize and local clifford, where X is a random variable
              that accounts for the depth from the layers of random 1-qubit Cliffords (X = 2 if the 1
              qubit Clifford gates are "native" gates in the QubitProcessorSpec).
    Tuple
        A length-n tuple of integers in [0,1], corresponding to the error-free outcome of the
        circuit. Always all zeros if `randomizeout` is False. The ith element of the tuple
        corresponds to the error-free outcome for the qubit labelled by: the ith element of
        `qubit_labels`, if `qubit_labels` is not None; the ith element of `pspec.qubit_labels`, otherwise.
        In both cases, the ith element of the tuple corresponds to the error-free outcome for the
        qubit on the ith wire of the output circuit.

    Makes a random 1-qubit RB circuit, with RB over an arbitrary group.

    This function also contains a range of other options that allow circuits for many
    types of RB to be generated, including:

    - Clifford RB
    - Direct RB
    - Interleaved Clifford or direct RB
    - Unitarity Clifford or direct RB

    The function can in-principle be used beyond 1-qubit RB, but it relies on explicit matrix representation
    of a group, which is infeasble for, e.g., the many-qubit Clifford group.

    Note that this function has *not* been carefully tested. This will be rectified in the future,
    or this function will be replaced.

    Parameters
    ----------
    m : int
        The number of random gates in the circuit.

    group_or_model : Model or MatrixGroup
        Which Model of MatrixGroup to create the random circuit for. If
        inverse is true and this is a Model, the Model gates must form
        a group (so in this case it requires the *target model* rather than
        a noisy model). When inverse is true, the MatrixGroup for the model
        is generated. Therefore, if inverse is true and the function is called
        multiple times, it will be much faster if the MatrixGroup is provided.

    inverse : Bool, optional
        If true, the random circuit is followed by its inverse gate. The model
        must form a group if this is true. If it is true then the circuit
        returned is length m+1 (2m+1) if interleaved is False (True).

    random_pauli : <TODO typ>, optional
        <TODO description>

    interleaved : Str, optional
        If not None, then a oplabel string. When a oplabel string is provided,
        every random gate is followed by this gate. So the returned circuit is of
        length 2m+1 (2m) if inverse is True (False).

    group_inverse_only : <TODO typ>, optional
        <TODO description>

    group_prep : bool, optional
        If group_inverse_only is True and inverse is True, setting this to true
        creates a "group pre-twirl". Does nothing otherwise (which should be changed
        at some point).

    compilation : <TODO typ>, optional
        <TODO description>

    generated_group : <TODO typ>, optional
        <TODO description>

    model_to_group_labels : <TODO typ>, optional
        <TODO description>

    seed : int, optional
        Seed for random number generator; optional.

    rand_state : numpy.random.RandomState, optional
        A RandomState object to generate samples from. Can be useful to set
        instead of `seed` if you want reproducible distribution samples across
        multiple random function calls but you don't want to bother with
        manually incrementing seeds between those calls.

#     Makes a list of random RB sequences.

#     Parameters
#     ----------
#     m_list : list or array of ints
#         The set of depths for the random sequences (with the total
#         number of Cliffords in each sequence given by m_list + 1). Minimal
#         allowed length is therefore 1 (a random CLifford followed by its
#         inverse).

#     clifford_group : MatrixGroup
#         Which Clifford group to use.

#     K_m : int or dict
#         If an integer, the fixed number of Clifford sequences to be sampled at
#         each length m.  If a dictionary, then a mapping from Clifford
#         sequence length m to number of Cliffords to be sampled at that length.

#     alias_maps : dict of dicts, optional
#         If not None, a dictionary whose keys name other gate-label-sets, e.g.
#         "primitive" or "canonical", and whose values are "alias" dictionaries
#         which map the clifford labels (defined by `clifford_group`) to those
#         of the corresponding gate-label-set.  For example, the key "canonical"
#         might correspond to a dictionary "clifford_to_canonical" for which
#         (as one example) clifford_to_canonical['Gc1'] == ('Gy_pi2','Gy_pi2').

#     seed : int, optional
#         Seed for random number generator; optional.

#     rand_state : numpy.random.RandomState, optional
#         A RandomState object to generate samples from. Can be useful to set
#         instead of `seed` if you want reproducible distribution samples across
#         multiple random function calls but you don't want to bother with
#         manually incrementing seeds between those calls.

#     Returns
#     -------
#     dict or list
#         If `alias_maps` is not None, a dictionary of lists-of-circuit-lists
#         whose keys are 'clifford' and all of the keys of `alias_maps` (if any).
#         Values are lists of `Circuit` lists, one for each K_m value.  If
#         `alias_maps` is None, then just the list-of-lists corresponding to the
#         clifford operation labels is returned.
