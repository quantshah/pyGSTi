#     """
#     Implements a "standard practice" analysis of RB data. Fits the average success probabilities to the exponential
#     decay A + Bp^m, using least-squares fitting, with (1) A fixed (as standard, to 1/2^n where n is the number of
#     qubits the data is for), and (2) A, B and p all allowed to varying. Confidence intervals are also estimated using
#     a standard non-parameteric boostrap.

#     Parameters
#     ----------
#     RBSdataset : RBSummaryDataset
#         An RBSUmmaryDataset containing the data to analyze

#     seed : list, optional
#         Seeds for the fit of B and p (A is seeded to the asymptote defined by `asympote`).

#     bootstrap_samples : int, optional
#         The number of samples in the bootstrap.

#     asymptote : str or float, optional
#         The A value for the fitting to A + Bp^m with A fixed. If a string must be 'std', in
#         in which case A is fixed to 1/2^n.

#     rtype : {'EI','AGI'}, optional
#         The RB error rate rescaling convention. 'EI' results in RB error rates that are associated
#         with the entanglement infidelity, which is the error probability with stochastic errors (and
#         is equal to the diamond distance). 'AGI' results in RB error rates that are associated with
#         average gate infidelity.

#     Returns
#     -------
#     RBResults
#         An object encapsulating the RB results (and data).

    Implements a "standard" least-squares fit of RB data.

    Fits the average success probabilities to the exponential decay A + Bp^m, using least-squares fitting.

    Parameters
    ----------
    lengths : list
        The RB lengths to fit to (the 'm' values in A + Bp^m).

    asps : list
        The average survival probabilities to fit (the observed P_m values to fit
        to P_m = A + Bp^m).

    n : int
        The number of qubits the data was generated from.

    seed : list, optional
        Seeds for the fit of B and p (A, if a variable, is seeded to the asymptote defined by `asympote`).

    asymptote : float, optional
        If not None, the A value for the fitting to A + Bp^m with A fixed. Defaults to 1/2^n.
        Note that this value is used even when fitting A; in that case B and p are estimated
        with A fixed to this value, and then this A and the estimated B and p are seed for the
        full fit.

    ftype : {'full','FA','full+FA'}, optional
        The fit type to implement. 'full' corresponds to fitting all of A, B and p. 'FA' corresponds

        with the entanglement infidelity, which is the error probability with stochastic errors (and
        is equal to the diamond distance). 'AGI' results in RB error rates that are associated with

        If `ftype` = 'full+FA' then two dicts are returned. The first dict corresponds to the full fit
