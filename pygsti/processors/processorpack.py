    """
    The device specification for a quantum computer and associated models and compilation libraries.

    This is objected is geared towards multi-qubit devices; many of the contained
    structures are superfluous in the case of a single qubit.

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_qubits : int
        The number of qubits in the device.

    gate_names : list of strings
        The names of gates in the device.  This may include standard gate
        names known by pyGSTi (see below) or names which appear in the
        `nonstd_gate_unitaries` argument. The set of standard gate names
        includes, but is not limited to:

        - 'Gi' : the 1Q idle operation
        - 'Gx','Gy','Gz' : 1-qubit pi/2 rotations
        - 'Gxpi','Gypi','Gzpi' : 1-qubit pi rotations
        - 'Gh' : Hadamard
        - 'Gp' : phase or S-gate (i.e., ((1,0),(0,i)))
        - 'Gcphase','Gcnot','Gswap' : standard 2-qubit gates

        Alternative names can be used for all or any of these gates, but
        then they must be explicitly defined in the `nonstd_gate_unitaries`
        dictionary.  Including any standard names in `nonstd_gate_unitaries`
        overrides the default (builtin) unitary with the one supplied.

    nonstd_gate_unitaries: dictionary of numpy arrays
        A dictionary with keys that are gate names (strings) and values that are numpy arrays specifying
        quantum gates in terms of unitary matrices. This is an additional "lookup" database of unitaries -
        to add a gate to this `ProcessorSpec` its names still needs to appear in the `gate_names` list.
        This dictionary's values specify additional (target) native gates that can be implemented in the device
        as unitaries acting on ordinary pure-state-vectors, in the standard computationl basis. These unitaries
        need not, and often should not, be unitaries acting on all of the qubits. E.g., a CNOT gate is specified
        by a key that is the desired name for CNOT, and a value that is the standard 4 x 4 complex matrix for CNOT.
        All gate names must start with 'G'.  As an advanced behavior, a unitary-matrix-returning function which
        takes a single argument - a tuple of label arguments - may be given instead of a single matrix to create
        an operation *factory* which allows continuously-parameterized gates.  This function must also return
        an empty/dummy unitary when `None` is given as it's argument.

    availability : dict, optional
        A dictionary whose keys are some subset of the keys (which are gate names) `nonstd_gate_unitaries` and the
        strings (which are gate names) in `gate_names` and whose values are lists of qubit-label-tuples.  Each
        qubit-label-tuple must have length equal to the number of qubits the corresponding gate acts upon, and
        causes that gate to be available to act on the specified qubits. Instead of a list of tuples, values of
        `availability` may take the special values `"all-permutations"` and `"all-combinations"`, which as their
        names imply, equate to all possible permutations and combinations of the appropriate number of qubit labels
        (deterined by the gate's dimension). If a gate name is not present in `availability`, the default is
        `"all-permutations"`.  So, the availability of a gate only needs to be specified when it cannot act in every
        valid way on the qubits (e.g., the device does not have all-to-all connectivity).

    qubit_labels : list or tuple, optional
        The labels (integers or strings) of the qubits.  If `None`, then the integers starting with zero are used.

    construct_models : tuple, optional
        Standard model for the gates to add.
            - If 'target' is in the tuple, "target" process matrices corresponding to ideal gates are added.
            - If 'clifford' is in the tuple, the Clifford gates in the model are represented in their efficient-in-n
            symplectic form (these are reps. of perfect gates).

    construct_clifford_compilations : dict, optional
        The compilations for "standard" Clifford gates that are constructed. These are mostly only of importance for
        compiling many-qubit Clifford gates, and similar tasks related to creating randomized benchmarking circuits.
        The standard option is exhaustive (i.e., there are no further allowed options), and leaving this as-is
        should be fine for most purposes.

    verbosity : int, optional
        If > 0, information about the generation of the ProcessorSpec is printed to the screen.
