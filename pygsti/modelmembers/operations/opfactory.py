class OpFactory(_gm.ModelMember):
    """
    An object that can generate "on-demand" operators (can be SPAM vecs, etc., as well) for a Model.

    It is assigned certain parameter indices (it's a ModelMember), which definie
    the block of indices it may assign to its created operations.

    The central method of an OpFactory object is the `create_op` method, which
    creates an operation that is associated with a given label.  This is very
    similar to a LayerLizard's function, though a LayerLizard has detailed
    knowledge and access to a Model's internals whereas an OpFactory is meant to
    create a self-contained class of operators (e.g. continuously parameterized
    gates or on-demand embedding).

    This class just provides a skeleton for an operation factory - derived
    classes add the actual code for creating custom objects.

    Parameters
    ----------
    state_space : StateSpace
        The state-space of the operation(s) this factory builds.

    evotype : Evotype
        The evolution type of the operation(s) this factory builds.

        Create the object that implements the operation associated with the given `args` and `sslbls`.

        **Note to developers**
        The difference beween this method and :method:`create_op` is that
        this method just creates the foundational object without needing
        to setup its parameter indices (a technical detail which connects
        the created object with the originating factory's parameters).  The
        base-class `create_op` method calls `create_object` and then performs
        some additional setup on the returned object before returning it
        itself.  Thus, unless you have a reason for implementing `create_op`
        it's often more convenient and robust to implement this function.

        Parameters
        ----------
        args : list or tuple

        sslbls : list or tuple

    An operation factory based on a unitary-matrix-producing function.

    Converts a function, `f(arg_tuple)`, that outputs a unitary matrix (operation)
    into a factory that produces a :class:`StaticArbitraryOp` superoperator.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fn : function
        A function that takes as it's only argument a tuple
        of label-arguments (arguments included in circuit labels,
        e.g. 'Gxrot;0.347') and returns a unitary matrix -- a
        complex numpy array that has dimension 2^nQubits, e.g.
        a 2x2 matrix in the 1-qubit case.

    state_space : StateSpace
        The state space of this factory, describing the space of these that the
        operations produced by this factory act upon.  The function `fn` should
        return a unitary matrix with dimension `state_space.udim`, e.g. a 2x2
        matrix when `state_space` describes a single qubit.

    superop_basis : Basis or {"std","pp","gm","qt"}
        The basis used to represent super-operators.  If the operations produced
        by this factor need to be given a dense superoperator representation, this
        basis is used.  Usually the default of `"pp"` is what you want.

    evotype : {"densitymx","statevec","stabilizer","svterm","cterm"}
        The evolution type of the operation(s) this factory builds.
